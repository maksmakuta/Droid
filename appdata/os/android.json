Furthermore, a new "Grammatical Inflection API" has been added to gender users according to their preferred grammatical gender.\n - Android 14 will provide the ability to increase the font size up to 200% compared to 130% in previous versions, combined with nonlinear font scaling to prevent large text elements on screen from scaling too large, and it is now possible to specify the temperature unit (Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin) which should be used in applications.\n - The Material You design language, introduced in Android 12 and supplemented in Android 13, gets revised default colors in Android 14. Android 14 also introduces additional lock screen customization options, such as multiple clock and weather styles.\n - A predictive back gesture animation shows the destination of the back gesture and indicates when the back gesture will close or return to another app.\n - For devices with a larger screen, such as tablets, the taskbar is expanded in Android 14 and now shows the names of the pinned apps.\n - Android 14 will allow a phone to be configured as a webcam when plugged into a computer or another Android device.\nBattery life\n- Android system processes are more efficient which provides battery life improvements. In addition, there is now the option to choose directly between energy-saving mode and extreme energy-saving mode.\n - The screen time since the last full charge is now displayed in the battery settings. The battery consumption is shown separately from system and user applications. This feature was replaced with the launch of Android 12 by showing battery usage over the past 24 hours.\nPrivacy and security\n - In order to improve privacy, the user can select which images an application may access.\n- Google is blocking the installation of apps that target versions of Android below Marshmallow (6.0). With Android 14, users will no longer be able to install apps that target SDK version 22 or lower. The change is intended to curb the spread of malware, which intentionally targets old versions of Android to bypass security restrictions introduced in newer versions. An ADB install flag has been added to bypass the restriction.\n - There is also a small change for guest mode or multiuser mode, where the "Allow guest to use phone" option has been moved to the top level menu. Previously, this option was behind the guest account itself.\nHealth Connect\n -Incorporating Health Connect as one of the new features of Android 14, users can now access it through the all-new Pixel's settings menu. Health Connect collaborates with apps like Fitbit, Samsung Health, and Google Fit.",
